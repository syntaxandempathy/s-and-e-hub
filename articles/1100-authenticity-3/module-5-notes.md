From the expert:
Looks good—you can move on. Here’s a crisp assessment of your **Module 5** drop plus the few notes I’d add to the notes file.

# Verdict

**Greenlight for Module 6.** Artifacts and metadata indicate Module 5 meets the intent (semantic coherence & drift at version and window levels, aligned to M2 windows).

# What I verified

* **Artifacts present:** `semantic_metrics.parquet`, `semantic_windows.parquet`, `semantic_deltas.parquet`, and a `plots/` folder (4 PNGs found).
* **Metadata is clean:**
  `model_name=all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `model_dim=384`, `normalize_embeddings=True`, `batch_size=64`, `device=cpu`, `uses_m2_windows=True`, `version_order_source="filename_prefix"`, `enable_nli=False`, plus article/version counts.
* **Plots present:**

  * `coherence_doc_violin.png`
  * `trend_coherence_the-count-that-coudnt_.png` (trailing underscore—see polish)
  * `win_coherence_the-count-that-coudnt.png`
  * `cosine_heatmap_the-count-that-coudnt_v1.png`

(I couldn’t open Parquets in this sandbox due to missing parquet engine, but your bundle structure and metadata look correct.)

# Add these to your Module-5 notes (concise)

* **Provenance**

  * `version_order_source: "filename_prefix" (01–04)`
  * `model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (dim=384)`, `device=cpu`, `batch_size=64`, `normalize_embeddings=True`.
  * `uses_m2_windows: true`, alignment by **char spans** from M2.
* **Schemas (commit)**

  * `semantic_metrics.parquet` keys: `(article_id, version_id, version_tag, doc_id)`; metrics: `n_sents_sem, coherence_doc, dispersion_doc, redundancy_doc, semantic_drift_from_prev`.
  * `semantic_windows.parquet` keys/spans: `(article_id, version_id, win_id, win_label, span_basis, char_start, char_end, sent_start_index, sent_end_index, is_partial_tail)`; metrics: `n_sents_win, coherence_win, neighbor_sim_win, redundancy_win` (and any extras you included).
  * `semantic_deltas.parquet`: `(article_id, from_version, to_version, semantic_drift, d_coherence_doc, d_redundancy_doc)`; **adjacent pairs only**.
* **Ranges & guards (document)**

  * `coherence_*`, `neighbor_sim_*`, `redundancy_* ∈ [0,1]`; `semantic_drift ≥ 0` (typically ≤ \~0.6 for adjacent drafts).
  * Windows with `<2` sentences → metrics `NaN` (not zero).
* **Plot policy**

  * Per-article trends for versions and windows; heatmap capped to first \~120 sentences if long.
  * Note filename quirk (see below) or normalize.

# Minor polish (optional)

* **Filename normalization:** `trend_coherence_the-count-that-coudnt_.png` has a trailing `_`. Either normalize to `trend_coherence_<slug>.png` or note both are acceptable in the orchestrator.
* **Metadata enrich (nice):** add `skipped_sentences` count (e.g., very short sentences filtered) and `articles/versions_per_article_*` if not already exact.

# One-line QA you can run in Colab (optional)

Paste and execute to cement schema/ranges:

```python
import pandas as pd
doc = pd.read_parquet("outputs/semantic/semantic_metrics.parquet")
win = pd.read_parquet("outputs/semantic/semantic_windows.parquet")
dlt = pd.read_parquet("outputs/semantic/semantic_deltas.parquet")

print("doc rows:", len(doc), "win rows:", len(win), "dlt rows:", len(dlt))
print("coherence_doc in [0,1]:", doc["coherence_doc"].dropna().between(0,1).all())
print("redundancy_doc in [0,1]:", doc["redundancy_doc"].dropna().between(0,1).all())
print("adjacent only:", ((dlt["to_version"] - dlt["from_version"])==1).all())
ok = all(list(g["win_id"]) == list(range(1,len(g)+1)) 
         for _, g in win.sort_values(["article_id","version_id","win_id"]).groupby(["article_id","version_id"]))
print("win_id contiguous per version:", ok)
```

If those checks are clean on your side, we’re fully locked. Ready for **Module 6**.

From the code reviewer:
Got the updated Module 5 bundle—nice work. I pulled the new artifacts and metadata and here’s a tight review you can drop into the notes.

# Module 5 — Final assessment & notes

## What looks solid

* **Model + device pinned:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, dim=384, device=CPU, embeddings normalized (cosine in \[0,1]).
* **Window policy matches M2:** `from_module_2_spans/full_containment` with `windows_total=349`, `windows_with_lt2_sentences=0` (good guard).
* **Clear coherence definition:** `cosine_mean_offdiag` (mean of off-diagonal sentence-pair similarities).
* **Artifacts produced:**

  * `semantic_metrics.parquet`
  * `coherence_doc.parquet`
  * `coherence_windows.parquet`
  * Plots: global doc violin, per-version trend, v1 heatmap, window distribution (index written).
* **Readme + metadata present** and reference the upstream M2 windows path.

## Minor nits / polish

* **Slug formatting:** several plot filenames use `the-count-that-coudnt` (typo “coudnt”) and one has a trailing underscore (`trend_coherence_the-count-that-coudnt_.png`). Suggest normalizing slugs to avoid trailing underscores and fix the title case/typo if that’s accidental.
* **Bundler manifest parity:** unlike Module 3, the `bundle_index.json` here doesn’t record per-parquet `rows/cols/schema`. Add those (as you did in M3) so QA can sanity-check contents without loading Parquet.
* **Seed disclosure:** inference is effectively deterministic, but add `seed: 7` (or `null`) in metadata for uniformity with earlier modules.
* **Cosine heatmaps:** only `v1` is rendered right now. Consider: render for **each version** (v1–v4) or at least the **first and last** to visualize drift.
* **Window plots cap:** current set is reasonable; if articles grow, keep the per-article plot cap consistent with M1–M3 (first 10 by slug) and note the cap in metadata.

## QA checks that passed (from the bundle)

* `uses_m2_windows: true`, policy recorded and consistent.
* `normalize_embeddings: true` → cosine is well-behaved; violin/trend plots should never exceed 1.0.
* **No <2-sentence windows** → no unexpected NaNs in `coherence_windows.parquet` expected.
* Plots exist and are non-empty (sizes look healthy in the archive).

## Suggested small additions to the notes (copy/paste)

* Coherence metric is `mean(off-diag cosine)` over sentence embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2, CPU, normalized).
* Windows reuse Module 2 spans with **full sentence containment**; windows with `<2` sentences are excluded (count = 0 in this run).
* Bundle includes doc-level and window-level coherence plus global/ per-version visuals.
* Known limitations: MiniLM is compact; for higher fidelity consider `all-mpnet-base-v2` behind a flag (heavier).
* Action item: add `rows/cols/schema` to `bundle_index.json` (align with Module 3), normalize slugs (remove trailing `_`, correct spelling), and optionally render heatmaps for v1 **and** v4.

If you want, I can also list the **expected column set** for each parquet (for a quick schema check in future runs).
