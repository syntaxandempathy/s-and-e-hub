From the expert:
Short answer: **you’re clear to proceed to Module 5.**

From the artifacts/screenshot, Module 4 hits the intent: distilgpt2 loaded, sentence-level pseudo-PPL computed, version + window aggregations produced, and the two plot types rendered. No blocking issues.

If you want to capture a couple of small items in the notes before moving on:

# Module 4 — add these to your notes (nice-to-have, not blockers)

* **Provenance**

  * `version_order_source: "filename_prefix"` (01–04).
  * `model_name: "distilgpt2"`, `transformers_version`, `torch_version`, `device: "cpu"|"cuda"`.
  * `batch_size_used` (≤ 8), `truncation_max_bpe` (e.g., 128), `tokenizer.padding_side="left"`, `pad_token=eos`.
* **Guards & skips**

  * Minimum BPE tokens per sentence (e.g., `<3` are skipped) and **count of skipped sentences** per version (log this in metadata).
* **Schematization (for downstream joins)**

  * Version table keys: `(article_id, version_id, version_tag, doc_id)` + counts and PPL/NLL stats.
  * Window table keys: `(article_id, version_id, win_id, win_label)` + `span_basis, char_start, char_end, sent_start_index, sent_end_index, is_partial_tail` + PPL/NLL stats.
* **Plot policy**

  * Global PPL histogram clipping rule (e.g., clip at 99th percentile).
  * Per-article trend filenames you generated (version trend + window trend) and any cap on number of slugs plotted.

# Tiny polish (optional)

* Add `ppl_cv_ver` / `ppl_cv_win` (coefficient of variation) if you haven’t—useful for “smoothing” signals.
* If you ever compute SLOR later, note it as a new field; fine to skip for now.

With that, Module 4 is “done enough” for our purposes. Ready for **Module 5 — SBERT embeddings & semantic stability**, joined on the same keys `(article_id, version_id, win_id)` and aligned to Module-2 spans.

Short answer: you’re good to proceed to the next module.
Longer answer: here’s a tight QA read on the Module 4 bundle + what I’d add to the notes.

# What’s in the bundle (looks correct)

* Artifacts: `perplexity.parquet` (42×14), `perplexity_windows.parquet` (126×16), `metadata.json`, `bundle_index.json`, `README.txt`, `checksums.txt`, and 3 plots (global histogram + per-article trends).
* Model: `distilgpt2` (HF Transformers), device: CPU, seed: 7.
* Window policy recorded: **sentence\_full\_containment**; version order source: **filename\_prefix**.
* Plots index present; checksums present. Nice.

# Sanity checks that pass

* Both document-level and window-level tables exist; row counts align (3 windows per doc).
* Metadata is explicit about model, device, policy, and versions.
* Plots render and are saved; global histogram plus per-article trends are the right minimal set.

# Nits / optional polish before we forget

1. **Typos in plot filenames** – e.g., `the-count-that-coudnt`. If that slug came from a filename, fine; otherwise consider normalizing or correcting for clarity in reports.
2. **Torch version string** – metadata shows a CUDA-flavored build string (e.g., `+cu126`). You ran CPU-only; that’s fine, but add a note: “CPU execution; CUDA suffix is build metadata only.”
3. **Column glossary** – add the exact columns for both Parquet files to the notes (names + units). E.g., `ppl`, `ppl_per_token`, `surprisal_mean`, `n_tokens_effective`, `runtime_ms`, etc. That saves someone having to crack the Parquet later.
4. **Length guard** – confirm (in notes) the rule for very short texts/windows (e.g., tokens < N): do we report `NaN`, skip the row, or still compute with a warning? If you already guarded, just document the threshold (common: N=10).
5. **Tokenizer caveat** – remind future readers that perplexity is *model- and tokenizer-specific*. Comparisons are valid *within this module/model* but not across different models/tokenizers.
6. **Outlier handling** – add a one-liner on how you treated extreme values (very high PPL) and whether any clipping/log-space was used. If none, say “no clipping; histogram is raw”.
7. **Windows alignment** – reiterate the selection rule used for windows: “only sentences fully contained in \[start\:end)”. That’s in metadata; echo it in the notes so it isn’t missed.
8. **Reproducibility knobs** – record the batch size/stride/max\_length used by the scorer (if applicable). If defaults were used, say so.
9. **Non-English detection** – if your corpus can include non-EN, add a caveat: GPT-2 English perplexity isn’t meaningful for non-EN and will trend high.
10. **Performance breadcrumb** – optional: include total runtime and docs/sec from the run; helps capacity planning later.

# Suggested “Notes” snippet to paste

* Model: `distilgpt2` (HF Transformers), device=CPU, seed=7.
* Perplexity computed on cleaned text; tokenizer = model default (BPE).
* Window policy: `sentence_full_containment` from Module-2 spans; 3 windows per doc.
* Very short segments (<10 tokens) → metrics may be `NaN`; no clipping applied.
* Perplexity is model+tokenizer specific; **do not compare** across other models.
* Torch build string may include `+cu*`; execution here is CPU-only.
* Artifacts: `perplexity.parquet` (docs), `perplexity_windows.parquet` (windows), plots (global histogram; per-article trends), checksums + manifest.
* Known limitation: non-English text yields inflated/unstable PPL.

If you add those, Module 4 is cleanly documented. Ready for Module 5.
