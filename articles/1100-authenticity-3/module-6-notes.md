Code Reviewer Notes:
Here are the notes I‚Äôd add for **Module 6 (BERTopic)**‚Äîshort, paste-ready, and focused on QA + futureproofing rather than code.

---

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs solid

* Uses Module-2 window spans and preserves `(article_id, version_id, win_id)` alignment throughout.
* Determinism knobs in place (UMAP `random_state`, KMeans `random_state`, fixed seeds) and embeddings cached (`.npy` + `embedding_rows.parquet`).
* Graceful fallbacks: HDBSCAN‚Üísmaller min cluster‚ÜíKMeans; recorded in `metadata.json`.
* Clear artifacts: `topics.parquet`, `topic_info.parquet`, `topic_metrics.parquet`, plots, and bundle with manifest/checksums.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Add these to the notes (behavioral assumptions & caveats)

1. **Window alignment assumption**

   * All ‚Äúchurn‚Äù metrics align windows **by `win_id`** across versions. This presumes the window generator is stable across edits. If text length shifts, some windows may not be semantically comparable.
   * Mitigation: (for interpretation) treat reassignment/overlap as *positional* rather than semantic unless a similarity gate is applied.

2. **Determinism & runtime**

   * Seeds set for NumPy/torch; UMAP has `random_state=42`. HDBSCAN is deterministic given inputs.
   * For full reproducibility on CPU: consider fixing BLAS thread envs (`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1`, etc.). On GPU, PyTorch/CuDNN can introduce non-determinism; current code prefers CPU unless `LSA_ALLOW_CUDA=1`.

3. **Dependency install risk**

   * `hdbscan` sometimes compiles from source on niche platforms. Current cell doesn‚Äôt enforce wheels-only; be aware in constrained environments.

4. **Empty/short windows**

   * Windows with very few characters/tokens produce low-information embeddings and can inflate noise. Current pipeline embeds all windows (including empty strings) and does not filter.
   * Interpretation note: elevated **noise rate** may reflect short/boilerplate windows, not just clustering weakness.

5. **Metadata clarity**

   * When KMeans fallback is used, `metadata["hdbscan_params"]["min_cluster_size"]` currently reflects a value derived from the fallback dict (may show `k`). Record an explicit field, e.g., `"clustering_algo": "hdbscan" | "kmeans"` and store the *actual* HDBSCAN params separately from KMeans `k`. (Purely a documentation/interpretation concern.)

6. **Topic labels**

   * `topic_label` pulls top terms from BERTopic where available; for KMeans fallback it uses `km_<id>`. That‚Äôs expected‚Äîjust note that labels are **not** globally re-aligned across runs if the clustering changes.

7. **Metrics interpretation**

   * Per-version **entropy** excludes noise; a second metric includes noise. Use both when diagnosing: decreases in entropy alongside reduced topic count and increased mean coherence are a good ‚Äúregularization‚Äù cue (already flagged).
   * **Hungarian overlap** uses window intersections; ties can produce alternative optimal matchings. Treat Jaccard as *approximate* overlap signal, not identity mapping.

8. **Visuals**

   * Timelines color topics by `topic_id` (noise in gray). For high topic counts, the scatter can overplot; reading the figure is easier when filtered to the top-k topics by support. (Purely a UX note; artifacts are fine.)

9. **Scaling**

   * Embeddings are stored once per run and reused for metrics‚Äîgood. For very large corpora, memory is dominated by `N √ó d` embeddings; keep `BATCH` moderate to avoid spikes.

10. **Offline/air-gapped runs**

    * SentenceTransformer will fetch the model if not cached. If internet is unavailable, pre-cache `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` in the environment; otherwise the install cell is fine.

---

### üß™ Quick QA checks to keep in the notes

* **Consistency check:** `len(embeddings) == topics.parquet.shape[0] == embedding_rows.parquet['row_id'].max()+1`.
* **Noise rate per version:** `% noise` by version ‚â§ expected threshold for your corpus; big spikes usually indicate lots of short windows.
* **Fallback log:** `metadata.json` should include `"fallback": null` in the normal case; if KMeans triggered, sanity-check that `topic_info.parquet` has `km_*` names.
* **Births+deaths sanity:** In `topic_metrics.parquet` for each pair `(v, v+1)`, births and deaths shouldn‚Äôt both be zero unless topics carry forward 1-to-1.

---

### Optional (nice-to-have later; not blocking)

* Persist the BERTopic model (`.save`) so top terms/representations are inspectable without refitting.
* Record **noise\_rate** per version in `topic_metrics.parquet` to aid triage.
* Consider a **similarity gate** for reassignment (e.g., only count windows with token Jaccard or embedding cosine ‚â• œÑ across versions) to separate content drift from position drift.

If you capture the above in the notes, Module 6 looks solid and ready to feed into downstream analysis.
