This article series documents the process of building tools to measure and visualize the balance between AI-generated and human-contributed content in collaborative writing. The project explores both the technical challenges of text analysis and the deeper questions about transparency in AI-assisted work.

## Research Question

**Core Question**: How can we transparently measure AI vs. human contribution in collaborative writing processes?

**Sub-questions**:
- What metrics best capture the collaborative writing process?
- How do iterative edits change the AI/human balance?
- What insights emerge from failed attempts at tool building?
- How can we make AI collaboration more transparent and accountable?
