# Charts Export Directory

*This directory contains PNG files for use in reporting and presentations.*

## Overview
This directory contains a collection of PNG charts and images related to editorial impact and content transformation.  These visuals are intended for use in presentations, reports, and internal documentation.  The images are pre-generated and ready to be used as-is.  No further processing or generation is required. Currently, all files are marked as skipped in the metadata, and thus not directly accessible through automated processes.

## Contents
* `01_human_editorial_impact.png` — Chart showing human editorial impact.
* `02_content_transformation_types.png` — Chart showing content transformation types.
* `03_editorial_journey.png` — Chart illustrating the editorial journey.
* `04_summary_metric.png` — Chart summarizing key metrics.

## Conventions
All files are PNG images.  File naming follows a consistent pattern (numbering, descriptive name).
