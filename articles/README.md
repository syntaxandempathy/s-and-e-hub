# Articles Directory

*This directory houses a collection of articles on AI, technology, and human creativity, presented in a browsable grid format.*

**Overview**

This directory contains markdown files (.md) for articles exploring the intersection of AI, technology, and human creativity.  The articles are organized and displayed using a configurable listing structure defined in `index.md`.  Navigation and filtering are supported through a user interface generated from the `index.md` configuration.  New articles can be added as additional `.md` files in this directory.  The `index.md` file automatically updates the displayed grid.

**Contents**

* `index.md`:  Configuration file and landing page for the article collection.
* `.gitkeep`:  Empty file to ensure the directory is tracked by Git.


**Structure**

Articles are stored as individual markdown files (.md).  Each file should follow a consistent structure, including frontmatter for metadata such as title, date, description, and categories.  The `index.md` file uses this metadata to generate the article grid.
