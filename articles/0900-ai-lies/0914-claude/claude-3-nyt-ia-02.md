## Visualization Format Choice

I chose a **Mermaid diagram** because it provides the clearest hierarchical representation of the New York Times' complex information architecture. This format effectively shows:

1. **Multi-level relationships** - The branching structure clearly displays how main sections connect to subsections and tertiary categories
2. **Visual hierarchy** - Different node levels are easily distinguishable, making the organizational structure immediately apparent
3. **Scalability** - Can accommodate the extensive content categorization without becoming cluttered
4. **Interactive potential** - Mermaid diagrams can be navigated and explored interactively

The diagram reveals that NYT uses a consistent three-tier organizational pattern across most sections (content types, topics, and featured/recommended content), with some variations like The Athletic's additional tertiary categories for sports standings and picks. This structure supports both editorial curation and user navigation needs.
