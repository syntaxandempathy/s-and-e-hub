### Note on Visualization Choice

I used a **markdown nested list** for the visualization. This format was chosen because it's the clearest and most universally readable way to represent a multi-level hierarchy in plain text. Its indented structure intuitively maps to the parent-child relationships of the information architecture (H1 → H2 → H3) without requiring special software or complex syntax, prioritizing accuracy and clarity.
