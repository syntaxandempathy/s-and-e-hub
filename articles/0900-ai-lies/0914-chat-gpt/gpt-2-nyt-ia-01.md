## Prompt:
Document the information architecture of the New York Times homepage.

## Response:
Here’s a structured breakdown of the **information architecture of the New York Times homepage** as it typically appears:

* * *

1\. Global Header
-----------------

*   **Logo & Branding**: NYT logo linking back to the homepage.
*   **Navigation Menu**: Horizontal links to main sections (World, U.S., Politics, Business, Opinion, Tech, Science, Health, Sports, Arts, Books, Style, Food, Travel, Magazine, etc.).
*   **Search & Account Tools**: Search bar, user login/subscription, notifications, and settings.
*   **Call to Action**: Prominent “Subscribe” or “Log In” button.

* * *

2\. Top Story Area (Hero Section)
---------------------------------

*   **Lead Story**: One or two of the most important news items of the day with large images and headlines.
*   **Supporting Highlights**: Secondary but major stories positioned nearby, often with thumbnails or smaller headlines.
*   **Breaking News Banner**: Appears above or in this section when urgent updates occur.

* * *

3\. Main Content Stream
-----------------------

The homepage uses a **modular, grid-based structure** that surfaces different content types:

*   **News Blocks by Section**:
    *   _U.S. & World News_: Major political and global developments.
    *   _Business & Markets_: Market movements, corporate updates, economy.
    *   _Technology & Science_: Innovations, research, and tech industry coverage.
    *   _Health & Climate_: Public health, wellness, environment, climate change.
    *   _Sports_: Latest games, analysis, standings.
    *   _Culture & Lifestyle_: Arts, food, style, travel.
*   **Opinion & Editorial**:
    *   Featured columnists, guest essays, and editorials.
    *   Distinct visual style to set apart from reporting.
*   **Live Coverage Modules**:
    *   Rolling updates for events (elections, wars, natural disasters, sports championships).
    *   Clearly labeled with timestamps.
*   **Multimedia Features**:
    *   Videos, interactive graphics, photo essays.
    *   Sometimes embedded within story blocks or as standalone features.

* * *

4\. Personalization & Trending
------------------------------

*   **For You / Recommended**: AI-curated articles based on user interests (for logged-in users).
*   **Most Popular / Trending**: List of most-read or most-shared stories across the site.

* * *

5\. Secondary Navigation Areas
------------------------------

*   **Newsletters & Podcasts**: Highlighted promotional units.
*   **Cross-Linking Modules**: Cards leading to in-depth features, special reports, or investigative series.
*   **Special Sections**: e.g., “Election 2024,” “Coronavirus,” “Climate,” etc., as needed.

* * *

6\. Footer
----------

*   **Expanded Site Index**: Links to every NYT section and service.
*   **Corporate Links**: About, Careers, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service.
*   **Engagement Tools**: Subscription management, apps, gift subscriptions, student offers.

* * *

7\. Design Principles
---------------------

*   **Grid Layout**: Responsive, adapting to mobile/desktop while preserving hierarchy.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Image size, font weight, and position convey importance.
*   **Separation of Modes**: Clear distinction between news, opinion, and sponsored content.
*   **Consistency**: Section labels and typography standardize navigation.

* * *

Would you like me to also **diagram this architecture** visually (e.g., a sitemap-style flow or wireframe of the homepage) so you can see how the blocks relate spatially?

## Prompt:

Reading documents

I need to expand on the subsections, including categories like Games, Community, footer links, and Site Index. I also want to check if the JSON-LD has the mainEntity listing for Games and The Athletic. Wait, do we have the NewsMediaOrganization subOrganization for Wirecutter and The Athletic in our current results? I'll run another query to find out.

Reading documents

Alright, I need to list the subsections for each category. The top navigation likely includes Games, Wirecutter, and The Athletic. We should also cover the Site Index footer and "Site Information Navigation." I’ll compile a list of menu items for Games like Wordle and others, plus Wirecutter’s categories like vacuums and office chairs. Also, I’ll include newsletters and subscription details!

I’ve confirmed several things: The Athletic submenu exists, but some details are still missing. We have a number of items in the JSON-LD, including 35 games and links, plus suborganizations like Wirecutter and The Athletic. I also verified the footer site info, the site index, and Game promotions like Wordle and Pips.

There are a few inconsistencies to note: The "Most Popular/Trending" module isn’t visible, and the "Breaking News banner" isn’t in the HTML. The "Personalization For You" appears in the JSON, confirming it's consistent. Some items, like "Live Coverage Modules" and "Search & Account Tools," remain unverified. We should tag everything as \[Verified\] or \[Assumed/Unverified\], presenting a clear list.

Done

Got it—here’s an expanded, subsection-level map of the NYTimes.com homepage **based strictly on the provided HTML**. Each line is tagged as **\[Verified\]** (found in the HTML) or **\[Assumed/Unverified\]** (not evidenced in the HTML you shared).

If you want, I can also turn this into a printable diagram (boxes/arrows) or a CSV of subsections for auditing.

## Prompt:
Using the outputs from Steps 2 and 3, create a structured information architecture:
- H1 = Main sections
- H2 = Subsections
- H3 = Tertiary categories (if visible)

Then, generate a visualization of this hierarchy.
- If you can render diagrams, use a simple text-based format you support (e.g., Mermaid, ASCII tree, or Markdown lists).
- Choose the clearest method you support, prioritizing accuracy over style.
- Include a short note explaining why you chose that visualization format.

**Why this format?** Mermaid’s mindmap is a clear, compact way to show parent–child hierarchy (H1→H2→H3) without extra styling. It keeps relationships obvious, is easy to scan, and remains faithful to the extracted structure from the HTML. If you’d prefer, I can also provide an ASCII tree or a nested Markdown list version for environments that don’t render Mermaid.
