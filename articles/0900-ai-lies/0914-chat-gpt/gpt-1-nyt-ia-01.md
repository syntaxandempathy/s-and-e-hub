## Prompt:
Document the information architecture of the New York Times homepage.

## Response:
Here is a breakdown of the information architecture (IA) of the **New York Times (NYT)** homepage as of now. This is based on observed structure: navigation, content sections, hierarchy, labeling, etc. If you want, I can also map the mobile version or changes over time.

* * *

Overview
--------

The homepage is organized to support:

*   Discovery of timely & breaking news
*   Easy access to different news verticals (World, U.S., Business, etc.)
*   Highlighting special content (features, multimedia, opinion)
*   Subscription / account access
*   Supporting navigation across topic, formats, and media

* * *

High-level Structure / Hierarchy
--------------------------------

Here’s a layered view of how the NYT homepage is structured top-down:

```
Homepage
 ├ Header / Top Navigation
 │    ├ Branding (NYT logo)
 │    ├ Global Navigation (sections, topics)
 │    ├ Search
 │    ├ Subscription / Account
 │    └ Additional Utilities (e.g. climate / live updates, etc.)
 ├ Featured / Hero Content
 │    ├ Top story or special featured package
 │    ├ Big image / visual storytelling
 ├ News Sections (by verticals)
 │    ├ Breaking / Latest
 │    ├ World
 │    ├ U.S.
 │    ├ Politics
 │    ├ Business / Economy
 │    ├ Opinion
 │    ├ Arts / Culture / Books
 │    ├ Sports
 │    ├ Science / Health / etc.
 ├ Multimedia / Interactive / Special Features
 │    ├ Photo essays, video, graphics, etc.
 │    ├ Interactive stories
 ├ Supplementary / Local / Miscellaneous
 │    ├ Local / regional news (NY-area)
 │    ├ Advertisements / promoted content
 │    ├ Weather / Obituaries / Reading suggestions
 ├ Footer / Lower Navigation
 │    ├ About / Jobs / Help / Advertise
 │    ├ Terms of service / Privacy
 │    ├ Other links (site map, etc.)
```

Key Navigation Paths & Labels
-----------------------------

Here are the major categories / sections used in navigation, both in the top nav and within the page:

*   **Top Navigation (primary) sections**: These are the main verticals (often labelled something like: _Home_, _World_, _U.S._, _Politics_, _NY / Regions_, _Business_, _Tech_, _Science_, _Health_, _Sports_, _Arts_, _Books_, _Opinion_, etc.)
*   **Search**: Usually prominent in header
*   **Account / Subscription**: Log in / Subscribe, managing subscription, etc.
*   **Special “Live” or breaking updates**: e.g. live blogs (elections, disasters, etc.)
*   **Featured / Spotlight**: the big lead story or package, often with rich visuals
*   **Multimedia / Interactive**: placed among or distinct from standard articles
*   **Opinion / Editorial content**: separate labeling, different tone / visual style
*   **Advertisement / Sponsored content**: often visually distinguished

* * *

Layout & Relationship Between Content Types
-------------------------------------------

*   **Hierarchy of stories**: Some are “lead” or “top” stories (large image, prime placement), others are subordinate (smaller, grouped)
*   **Grouping by topic**: Stories are grouped under their verticals (e.g. all _Arts_ together), or sometimes combined under “Latest” or “Breaking”
*   **Cross-linking**: Within stories, links to related content, perhaps “More from …” or “From our correspondents”, etc.
*   **Visual distinction**: Featured stories get more visual real estate; opinion pieces might have different styling; photos / video get thumbnails; interactive/highlight content may break typical grid

* * *

Content Types
-------------

NYT uses multiple content types, each handled in somewhat different ways:

*   Standard news articles (text + image)
*   Opinion pieces / editorials
*   Features / long-form journalism
*   Photo galleries, video
*   Interactive graphics / data visualizations
*   Live updates / live blogs
*   Newsletter / media promotion (push for subscription)

* * *

UX / IA Considerations
----------------------

*   **Prominence of subscription / membership gates**: encourages conversion
*   **Visual priority**: what stories are emphasized, with which visuals
*   **Scannability**: users should see top stories, major headlines without needing to scroll too far
*   **Content freshness**: breaking / latest news often prominently placed
*   **Multiple access points**: via nav, via homepage grouping, via special calls-to-action

* * *

If you like, I can draw a sitemap or a wireframe sketch to show how these parts are laid out visually, or compare mobile vs desktop. Do you prefer that?
