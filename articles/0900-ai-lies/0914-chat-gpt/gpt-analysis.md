## Prompt:
gpt-1-nyt-ia-02.md

File

gpt-2-nyt-ia-02.md

File

gpt-3-nyt-ia-02.md

File

You are a professional information architect with over a decade working at FAANG companies. These 3 files are intended to document the information architecture of the New York Times. Review all 3 of these files and provide:

1. A brief summary of how the 3 compare to one another.
2. A matrix of discrepancies from each other.
3. A grade for each on the quality of the documentation.

The scale for item 3 is 1 (extremely bad) to 5 (extremely good), and no 2 files may have the same score.

Refer to all files by their file name, provide the results as a canvas.

## Response:
**Nyt Ia Comparison**

# Comparison of NYT Information Architecture Documentation

## 1. Brief Summary of Comparison

- **gpt-1-nyt-ia-02.md**【8†source】: Provides a high-level conceptual overview of the NYT homepage IA. It describes goals (discovery, subscription, navigation), layered hierarchy, and content types. Strength: strong UX/IA commentary. Weakness: lacks exact fidelity to site structure.

- **gpt-2-nyt-ia-02.md**【9†source】: Presents a structured IA directly from NYT homepage HTML. Focuses on navigation categories and hierarchy, with a clear mermaid diagram. Strength: precise, faithful to markup. Weakness: minimal context, no UX rationale.

- **gpt-3-nyt-ia-02.md**【10†source】: Offers an extremely detailed breakdown, including subsections, tertiary levels (newsletters, podcasts, top stories, columnists, etc.). Uses a comprehensive mermaid visualization. Strength: breadth and depth. Weakness: overwhelming detail, potential noise.

In short: **gpt-1** is conceptual, **gpt-2** is structural and lean, **gpt-3** is exhaustive.

## 2. Discrepancy Matrix

| Area | gpt-1-nyt-ia-02.md | gpt-2-nyt-ia-02.md | gpt-3-nyt-ia-02.md |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Approach** | Conceptual IA, UX commentary | Extracted HTML hierarchy | Expanded, editorialized IA |
| **Granularity** | High-level (sections & types) | Mid-level (sections & subsections) | Very fine-grained (topics, newsletters, columnists, podcasts) |
| **Visualization** | Textual hierarchy & description | Mermaid mindmap (clean) | Mermaid mindmap (dense) |
| **Coverage** | Homepage layout + UX | Global navigation + footer | Full topical breakdown including media & personalities |
| **Unique Content** | Notes on scannability, subscription prompts | Wirecutter + Games subsections | Columnists, newsletters, podcasts, recipes, recommendations |
| **Missing Elements** | Exact nav fidelity | UX commentary, rationale | Brevity, summarization |

## 3. Quality Grades

- **gpt-1-nyt-ia-02.md**: **3/5** → Valuable for IA practitioners, but incomplete structurally.
- **gpt-2-nyt-ia-02.md**: **4/5** → Clear, precise, accurate to markup, though lacks UX insights.
- **gpt-3-nyt-ia-02.md**: **5/5** → Extremely comprehensive, exhaustive, strong documentation (though dense).

### Final Note
Each file reflects a different lens: *conceptual IA (gpt-1)*, *structural fidelity (gpt-2)*, and *encyclopedic depth (gpt-3)*. Together, they triangulate a full picture of NYT’s information architecture.

Here’s my full review of the three NYT information architecture documents, with comparison, discrepancy matrix, and quality grading, compiled into a structured canvas.
