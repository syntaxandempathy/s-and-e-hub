**Why this format?** Mermaid’s mindmap is a clear, compact way to show parent–child hierarchy (H1→H2→H3) without extra styling. It keeps relationships obvious, is easy to scan, and remains faithful to the extracted structure from the HTML. If you’d prefer, I can also provide an ASCII tree or a nested Markdown list version for environments that don’t render Mermaid.
