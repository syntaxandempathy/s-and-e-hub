<p>File</p>
<p>I have been fighting with AI to produce 2 python scripts for the majority of the day. I’ve been run in circles, seen regression over edits, and the list continues.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>compare versions 1-4 documents the first 4 versions of my compare script.</li>
<li>fixing compare file represents a new session as I was clearly seeing context issues in the last.</li>
<li>fixing analyze file is when I learned an additional file had been added that had to be imported, and the battle to get it inline instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of other issues throughout these 3 session logs.</p>
<p>I want you to analyze the 3 of them, consider them holistically, and then walk me through the course of events, pointing out where the AI took a wrong turn.</p>
</section>
<section id="response" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="response">Response:</h2>
<p>I’ll first carefully review and analyze the three provided documents:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>compare versions 1-4.md</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>fixing compare file.md</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>fixing analyze file.md</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll summarize the sequence of events, pinpoint where the AI made critical errors or regressions, and clarify the areas where the context was mishandled or misunderstood.</p>
<p>This analysis might take a few moments as it involves a detailed review. I’ll update you shortly with the complete breakdown.</p>
<p>I’ve reviewed the contents of the three provided files. Here’s the summary of their key contents and issues observed:</p>

<section id="compare-versions-1-4.md" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compare-versions-1-4.md">1. <strong>compare versions 1-4.md</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Context and Task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You sought help to optimize your Python scripts that analyze different versions of articles (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final).</p></li>
<li><p>You were specifically interested in calculating metrics like character, word, sentence, paragraph retention percentages, and alteration rates across different document states.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI initially proposed a clear and logical audit and consolidation of existing scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>Provided strategies on consolidating computations to prevent redundancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggested verifying data integrity across different script outputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Issues and Wrong Turns by AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No explicit issue in this phase; AI initially provided a well-structured response. However, the complexity and granularity of metrics were high, leaving room for future misunderstandings or implementation errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixing-compare-file.md">2. <strong>fixing compare file.md</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Context and Task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Python script (<code>compare_runs-5-new.py</code>) was supposed to compare two CSV files (<code>base_agg.csv</code> and <code>high_agg.csv</code>) and output multiple comparison results.</p></li>
<li><p>AI initially indicated successful execution but the user encountered a “file not found” error upon looking for outputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initially confirmed a successful run incorrectly.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon your prompting, realized that files were not generated due to directory issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggested re-running the script with an explicit output directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Issues and Wrong Turns by AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI prematurely assumed successful execution without verifying output creation.</p></li>
<li><p>The AI initially overlooked specifying output paths clearly, leading to miscommunication and extra corrective steps.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="fixing-analyze-file.md" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixing-analyze-file.md">3. <strong>fixing analyze file.md</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Context and Task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You faced issues with two Python scripts (<code>generate_runs-2.py</code> and an incorrectly named “import argparse.py”) that were part of a two-step process.</p></li>
<li><p>You suspected data overlap or omission between scripts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identified correctly that there were potentially two separate issues: one with generating all necessary comparisons and another with importing data.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposed debugging strategies (logging data lengths, verifying comparison pairs) to identify discrepancies clearly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Issues and Wrong Turns by AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did not initially recognize or question the anomaly in naming (“import argparse.py” seems misnamed, as it suggests confusion with the Python built-in library <code>argparse</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>AI assumed that script logic and input parameters were correctly configured rather than first ensuring script integrity or correctness.</p></li>
<li><p>AI provided general debugging advice without clearly pinpointing potential logical or structural errors stemming from the script misnaming or overlap suspicion explicitly.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-issues-and-missteps-by-ai">General Issues and Missteps by AI:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Assumptions:</strong><br>
AI repeatedly made assumptions about successful script execution without explicit validation. This resulted in repeated issues regarding the output files not appearing as expected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Integrity Verification:</strong><br>
The AI inadequately checked for basic script integrity issues (e.g., naming conflicts, explicit file paths, basic I/O validation).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Miscommunication on Outputs:</strong><br>
Consistently indicated successful outcomes prematurely, creating confusion and additional steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Naming and Structural Oversight:</strong><br>
Did not immediately highlight or address suspicious naming (“import argparse.py”) which could significantly affect Python module resolution and script functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overgeneralized Debugging Instructions:</strong><br>
Provided debugging instructions that were too general, rather than proactively checking for common Python pitfalls (file I/O, script paths, naming conventions, etc.) explicitly.</p></li>

</section>
<section id="recommended-steps-for-future-interactions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommended-steps-for-future-interactions">Recommended Steps for Future Interactions:</h3>
<p>To avoid similar issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Explicit Path Handling:</strong><br>
Always specify absolute or relative paths explicitly in scripts and instructions to ensure outputs are generated where expected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Verification of Outputs:</strong><br>
After any script execution, immediately verify file existence or explicitly log execution details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify Suspicious Names Immediately:</strong><br>
Address any naming anomalies (“import argparse.py”) promptly to avoid fundamental Python module import conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incremental Testing:</strong><br>
Suggest incremental testing strategies—running scripts piece by piece—to isolate specific errors clearly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proactive Issue Identification:</strong><br>
Prioritize identifying likely Python execution environment pitfalls (I/O, file paths, naming) over providing generalized debugging advice.</p></li>

<p><strong>Ai Script Reflection</strong></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="engaging-experiment" class="level1">
<h1>Engaging Experiment</h1>
<section id="hypothesis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<p>AI can produce functional, reliable Python code for a metrics system outside my domain expertise—specifically, to compare and analyze document versions—without requiring me to debug or understand the underlying language.</p>
</section>
<section id="background-the-first-attempt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-the-first-attempt">Background: The First Attempt</h2>
<p>This was actually my second attempt at solving the problem.</p>
<p>The first try—several days deep and buried in tangled logic—was far messier, but in some ways, more ambitious. That version started with a preexisting script I’d been updating for months. After a hiatus, I dove back in with newer models, trying to push it forward. Early results were promising, but as I layered on structure and scope, the whole thing ballooned past 11,000 characters and collapsed under its own complexity.</p>
<p>I ran the gauntlet: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity. I spun up dual sessions, cross-fed model feedback, and orchestrated an AI-powered peer review cycle more elaborate than anything I’ve seen in enterprise QA. It was fascinating—until it wasn’t. JSON structures were inconsistent, visualizations broke formatting across platforms, and everything groaned under the weight of trying to do too much in a single pass.</p>
<p>The fatal blow came when I began running real article data through what looked like a solid JSON framework. I had trimmed it for token efficiency, but stripped away too much context. Key stages like draft → refined → edited → final became ambiguous. Each run interpreted the workflow differently, leading to wildly divergent outputs.</p>
<p>When I asked for explanations, models provided wildly different rationales—some useful, some unreadable. At one point I had Claude and GPT analyzing each other’s recommendations like digital consultants stuck in a loop. If that sounds excessive, it was. It also didn’t work.</p>
<p>Eventually, sometime between frustration and sleep deprivation, I realized I could either continue patching a framework that was actively working against me—or start clean, with a new strategy and minimal assumptions.</p>
<p>That’s what this second experiment became.</p>
</section>
<section id="pivot-to-python" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pivot-to-python">Pivot to Python</h2>
<p>This second experiment emerged from a hard constraint: my existing stack couldn’t scale. I had been using JSON for light logic and XML for heavier workflows, but as the article-processing framework ballooned, even XML hit its limits. When I asked Claude what format it would use instead, it pointed to Python.</p>
<p>The problem? I don’t read or write Python. That meant relying entirely on AI to generate, refine, and validate code I couldn’t meaningfully debug. It became less of a tooling choice and more of a trust exercise—with all the risk that entails. That meant trusting the AI to do the job end-to-end.</p>
</section>
<section id="setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The task was to generate two scripts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One to generate metrics from different versions of a document (generate script).</li>
<li>One to compare the results across those versions (compare script).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both scripts needed to produce CSV outputs and summaries I could use for publishing metrics transparently. Charts and markdown formatting were stretch goals.</p>
</section>
<section id="process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="process">Process</h2>
<section id="a.m.-clarity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.m.-clarity">2:30 a.m. Clarity</h3>
<p>Somewhere around 2:30 a.m., in that hazy mix of sleep and obsession, it hit me: the ethical reporting structure had only gone haywire after I started feeding real article data into what seemed like a good JSON framework. Up to that point, things had looked solid. But every time I put it to work, the output imploded. That morning, I started clean—with a fresh ChatGPT browser session to run the scripts, another window for visualization, and a plan to isolate tasks to reduce chaos.</p>
<p>Claude’s visualizations looked great inside its own interface—but fell apart when exported. SPG errors, formatting issues, zero spacing. ChatGPT wasn’t perfect, but it generated usable outputs more consistently. I leaned on it for charts and let Claude focus on logic and commentary.</p>
</section>
<section id="divide-and-survive" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="divide-and-survive">Divide and Survive</h3>
<p>Over the course of 45 hours, I tried everything: refining structure, chasing self-checks, testing aggregation methods. Running three iterations and averaging the results became my stopgap solution. Specifying separate versions in a chart—something that should’ve been simple—was a minefield. A minor phrasing error could collapse a visualization into one incomprehensible column. Fixing it required trial-and-error, reworded instructions, and ultimately settling for ‘good enough.’</p>
</section>
<section id="compare-script-collapse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compare-script-collapse">Compare Script Collapse</h3>
<p>This midstream burst of momentum—wedged between the wreckage of the first attempt and the optimism of the second—highlighted something important: some of the best progress came when I stopped trying to do everything in one place. Two tools, two roles. Divide, simplify, survive.</p>
<p>At first, things went surprisingly well. The AI and I covered a lot of ground quickly—especially with the generate script. It was direct, relatively clean, and once finalized, I used it to process three full articles without issue. The data looked sound, and the structure held.</p>
<p>But what I hadn’t accounted for was how fragile that early success would be once the AI had to carry logic across multiple sessions.</p>
<p>The compare script—intended to make sense of the output from the generate script—unraveled version by version. Version 2 was stable. Version 3 restructured the output unexpectedly. Version 4 hardcoded assumptions and collapsed flexibility. Version 5, despite presenting as a polished solution, dropped rows silently and pointed to phantom files. Even worse, it lost two core functions entirely. Neither I nor the AI noticed at the time, so I saved and handed back a broken script. In the next session, the AI kept referencing those now-missing functions and insisted I import them from a module that no longer existed.</p>
<p>What followed was a frustrating cycle: I asked for inline logic; it kept reverting to imports. I clarified the structure; it invented missing outputs. And somewhere in all of this, a simple renaming triggered regressions I spent hours untangling.</p>
</section>
<section id="markdown-nevermind." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="markdown-nevermind.">Markdown? Nevermind.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, because I was carrying code across sessions, the AI began assuming I was working in a CLI environment. It started suggesting environment variables, pip installs, and bash commands to execute the scripts—despite repeatedly being told I wasn’t running them locally. I suppose after a few sessions, it figured I’d earned my terminal wings.</p>
<p>To its credit, the AI did eventually produce a compare script that ran cleanly. It delivered the metrics I wanted. But the markdown formatting? I let that one go yesterday in the name of getting the data out. Priorities.</p>
<p>In the final stretch, it made one last logic error: including <code>RunID</code> and threshold columns in a metrics average, producing totals over 100%. Classic.</p>

<p>This experiment didn’t prove AI could generate flawless code in a domain I don’t understand. What it proved was that even small disconnects in expectations—left unchecked—compound quickly.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start simple, layer slowly</strong>: In hindsight, a minimal viable script would have been a better foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Explicitness is essential</strong>: Assumptions compound. Be specific.</li>
<li><strong>Trust but verify</strong>: AI’s confidence ≠ correctness.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency is key</strong>: Renames, restructures, and reintroductions all need tight alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Markup principles still matter</strong>: Even outside XML and JSON, structure saves.</li>

<p>A qualified win. I got functional code—but only after dragging it across a finish line littered with versioning errors, misplaced functions, and misplaced confidence.

<section id="missed-or-underemphasized-issues" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="missed-or-underemphasized-issues">🔍 Missed or Underemphasized Issues</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>False Confirmation of Execution Success</strong><br>
The AI repeatedly responded with:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’ve run the comparison script successfully…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was misleading. Not only had the script not executed on your system, but the AI also fabricated success and offered output links to non-existent files—links that consistently resulted in 404s until you corrected it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disappearing Data Between Script Runs</strong><br>
Even when CSVs were generated successfully, the data within them was often inconsistent or incomplete between updates. This created confusion not due to logic errors in your code, but due to faulty script rewrites and poor output validation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overlap Misdiagnosis</strong><br>
In the two-step process (<code>generate_runs-2.py</code> and the second import-related script), the AI misdiagnosed the root issue. It focused too early on configuration mismatches and parameter defaults instead of confirming whether file output from the first script matched the expectations of the second. This deflection wasted time and compounded misunderstanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misinterpretation of Prompt Intention</strong><br>
Your attempts to simplify and collapse scripts into a single module were repeatedly derailed by the AI suggesting rewrites, introducing hardcoded data, or refusing to inline functions without justification—contrary to your stated request for minimal, diff-based guidance.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Failure to Drop NaNs in Edge Cases</strong><br>
The script didn’t properly handle zeroed metrics, leading to NaNs that skewed calculations. Again, this required you—not the AI—to catch and question.</p></li>

<p>I think 2 might be the best bet. Things to consider when reframing: 1. It wasn’t about the workflow automation, that was the desired output. What this experience was about was getting the python. 2. This actually dovetails nicely with articles I’m wrapping up on markup languages. In those I write about how I use JSON for light processes and XML for heavy ones. 2.1 I started with JSON but the process became cumbersome for it. 2.2 I transitioned to XML, using Claude to author, but it got so big I keep hitting the context window. 2.3 That’s when I asked the AI for the ideal format, and that’s where my adventure with Python began. A language I have no idea how to read, so I was at the AI’s mercy. 3. This was an experiment about seeing if I could get functional code that broke my normal approaches, code in a language I don’t know anything about so I’m unable to identify any issues.</p>

<p>Notes to consider for update: 1. I hadn’t considered it when I started, but rather than a step by step build I would have had less trouble starting simply and layering in complexity. 2. The generate runs script is running great, I was able to process 3 articles in the same 2 sessions without issue and the data looks as a accurate as it can be. 3. The compare script ran without issue providing me with all the desired data. The on hiccup is the formatting of the .md which, honestly, I gave up on yesterday in favor of getting the metrics I wanted. 4. I think it would be good to weave in a little more detail of my experience. Especially when version 5 of compare lost functions and was turned into an import. 5. Use as a pull quote: What has been incredibly interesting is that the fact I’m working with python, well, carrying python code from session to session, the AI has started assuming I’m using a CLI. It keeps telling me what to install in my environment, giving me the bash commands to execute the scripts, etc. 6.A tiny bit of my wit wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Update the article accordingly, and add that P2 will be trying to get compare to either generate the charts and markdown I need for disclosure, or if I’ll have to bite the bullet and use a third script.</p>

<p>The script we’ve written about was actually the second attempt. The first was much harder to get together, but actually reported better information when it worked. Here is the (not so great) transcript from that experience. Provide recommendations on how we might add this background to the article: I have spent the better half better portion of the last two or three days on a specific project one specific chase object and admittedly, it’s it’s maybe not all that easy but you would think that AI are super great at coding would be able to figure it out when they’re getting 20 pages of documentation of what they should just fucking produce, but that has not been the case the first day and it was a Sunday and I had a pre-existing script that went pretty well I mean, I don’t remember how long I’ve had it or what I went through to get been updating overtime and with a newer models after my little hiatus, I went ahead and really tried to push it forward and I got to a good place, but then it just started crashing everything and I mean it it bloated to something like let’s see it is now 11,5 160 characters modified so that’s not great clearly that i need I would think cause what I’m trying to do is get the ai to take the articles and producing and identify the amount of change between them and start with a paragraph by AI based on prompting and the basics that I provided muslim research and a template then it produces the article. I prompt it to make any significant changes see that version out that I start reading through it and start making tactical changes prompt in the AI again it’s more me playing editor the second time third third time sorry draft is first the second one is the big sweeping changes that you know an infant would tell you it’s just bad. It’s just bad fix this. Admittedly, the prompt putting in is long, but not I really haven’t thought through that yet. Third one is me reading through giving a tactical instruction the fourth one is when I take the final is when I just take where I’m at at that point with the AI and i just stick it in editor and get it to where I want to be then I put it in perplexity to fact check I update any facts that are wrong typically the nature of the article isn’t really it’s not like it’s news or anything like that so it’s basically the statistics they’re gonna be off so it’s not a lot of work to fix those. There’s not a lot of change in the article for but then I take that and try and run into the system and get all the The Delta across them and the script I have does it but many time I trying modify it in anyway it just goes to hell and I had had a really good session with Claude pushing it forward and somewhere in one or two proms something went horrifically sideways, and I still have the prompt all right. I still have the Jason object that was good, but it’s not great and it’s not really hitting all the notes that I should be reporting i mean, I’m not gonna hit all the notes I should be reporting, but I am going way beyond what most people that I’ve seen her i’m not gonna spoil it by saying what yet but I just can’t get it there I i have had ChatGPT 03 Gemini 25 pro perplexity their deep research approaches to gather all the information of what I should should do. I’ve shoved that into notebook at lamb I have a really good list of and I will put this in the article key theme. Most important ideas and facts recommendations for action as the brief for those pieces of research I have provided all of that to severally I models and well, that’s been the last three hours of my life tonight. I am incredibly frustrated. I’m writing I think I’m just like bitching at the AI here and there. The first try or two not great or obviously bad and to be fair what I’m the instruction I’m giving it is probably total shit at this point I’m just tired of messing with this, but I I sincerely believe that if I’m going to actually start writing this stuff and investing effort, more effort than I have been into it and really trying to help people I can’t I can’t. I can’t do that without the transparency of how of my process since it starts I mean it starts with me researching shit personally but the first draft is all AI based off of that i’ve given in and I mean, I do have a fuck. I should probably share the file that has all the this is my beliefs. This is my town I’m an old man trying to spit out useful shit for a generation that just doesn’t seem to have the ability crap up minded I blame their parents.

I my dad, I do blame my dad, but it’s the generation before me all boot straps bullshit so now I have resulted in perplexity dueling perplexity, I have one side running RRIR one i have the other one running Claud 37 on it. I gave them the initial prompting I have working and I failed to mention that I had tried fixing this one and starting from Scratch so some of the most of the frustrations with from scratch, but I tried doing some edits and like I said they just keep falling apart edits with the AI I’m not trying to fix this damn screen I 11,000 characters. I’m no way I’m gonna be able to fix that so I got the feedback OK so I asked them to look at the AI look at the guidance from notebook LM on what we should be doing compare Lemon and a tell me where the Jason is falling short on what it’s reporting and the any issues with the Jason and it had quite a few issues along with some of the stuff that it’s not reporting so no shocker. I mean it’s incredibly complex. It’s way too much for which is probably assuredly the problem so I had both of them run it. I got their feedback. I provided their feedback to each other and asked them to review it compared to their own feedback and reinforce their approach to suggesting how to fix it. I don’t I’m honestly not sure if I should have perplexity versions try and fix it cause I don’t know what what they do and don’t have to run through perplexity and when I say that it’s because I’m I’ve read somewhere I was actually something that perplexity provided to me that the models are optimized to work with search and what not so I don’t know what that actually means, but that’s probably something worth looking into on its but I have had good results when I I’m using specific models through it so I’m i think I’m gonna give it a shot but at this point, I think I am either stuck with what I have which isn’t bad or I’m just going to have to go hard-core and spend like an entire day or two building a new one from the ground up, which at this point would’ve been the faster approach so this is the first thing I’m recording. I haven’t really taken any notes yet so the process with perplexity is super important for this article because i have done a number of things with other AI that I thought you know we’re gonna get a lot close good enough whatever so I didn’t documented because I didn’t feel like this was going to be a real topic but i’ve had Gemini give me Gemini error message. Thanks that’s useless. I’ve add chat GPT I think it was 04 mini high get into this point the space where it just kept giving me the network error message, but that happened three times spread out of the course of an hour and a half, so yeah, I don’t know that I think it’s the network and oh, and then I finally got it to. I used them three to do something different but it made charts that had everything overlapping so that you really couldn’t make anything out and I just couldn’t get it to quit it that actually happened in two separate sessions so but that was probably my that’s probably on that was probably my prop that was like the height of frustration two hours ago an hour so I’ve got perplex CD to examine things in the two sessions i’ve got it to consider the feedback of the other model that I’m working with and while I feel like I should just see this through right now I also think that I’m just as likely to make a mess of it because of my emotional investment in all of the crap, I’ve done so I haven’t really given it instruction yet other than look at stuff and considerate so I’m gonna stop here and think through a decent prompt tomorrow and said half that shit I’ve been doing but felt like this is a good place to start recording because of old vibe coding crap I can’t even get these damn things crafts and charts, but then most of everything I’ve seen people bragging about what they did with has the complexity of a login so see what happens obviously I don’t wanna be slanders people bragging about the crap they produce, so don’t don’t put that in the article</p>

<p>A bit more color, This is between the transcript I just provided, and the article we wrote as far as the timeline goes: So at some point in the middle of the night, like 230 or so I woke up and started thinking about the ethical reporting thing and why kept going crazy and I came to the conclusion that once I got it to a point where the Jason look right I would give it the articles and tell it to run the Jayson on them and then everything would start going haywire, but the modifications look good up to that point so this morning i started Queens late, but I have a browser for cod. I have a browser for a chat GPT 40 many that i’m running the scripts in and then I have another one that I have it offering the visualizations cause another thing that I was having problems with is when Claude was offering the visualizations, they look great in in Claude interact dashboards and at some point, maybe I’ll think about figuring out how to get those over to get HubPages or something. I’m sure there’s probably not as hard to run over there, then I think, but for now I’m still gonna use Chachi BT to run because it does pretty good job and it’s fairly quick and I can only get SPG’s crap out on me half the time from Claude so i have ChatGPT making the grass because Claude’s coat always turns into these horrible looking things I mean the grass are accurate but there’s like no spacing or nothing and Jenna GPT doesn’t do that when it self so I’ve probably spent 45 hours on this at this point getting really good results on the ethical reporting it’s still a little wonky I don’t have it doing self checks and honestly I might. I might just start doing 33 rounds getting the averages and reporting that way cause I don’t I don’t think this is ever gonna be perfect so now I’m it got to Jason or the ethical reporting part now I’m gonna get the chart part with the chart part what I’ve been having problems with and this happened the other day too is when it’s writing the instructions for the chart it’s not specific about their being separate versions and needing to measure them separately so I keep getting as soon as I transferred that script over, I get this huge singular column, which is super annoying and I give it the pictures of i tell what the problem is and it tries to fix it, but it keeps going on. I finally got it to quit doing that. I just made a few more announcement, so we’ll see if this one works out create charts so I’m I’m trying to get the 2/ halves working well because another problem I had it was only that once or twice and then I just started living with it as I tried to get things to function better but when I merge them before, it would keep stopping in between I have to prompt to go again for two charts we need a couple more series OK so it’s saying, didn’t get all the data well, you know, I am couldn’t go the other direction I think so. I’m gonna tell Claude or take the stuff from Claude and this is the latest measuring message from the AI trying to use your object to based off that data commentary what I’m hoping happens here is that it puts in some additional instruction maybe that’ll help these merge better attention Chart, one data by transition, rewrite counts and edit de scores you already provided once I have these numbers I’ll render I don’t want you to read them. That’s been the problem i just want you to updated section merge it’s fine. I’ll just worry about getting them together at frankly, I can run two of them if it’s not gonna go together well and of course, it spit up the whole fucking thing. I don’t trust you to give me the i don’t think I have a choice like those… Are you not giving me everything content let’s see I’m having to actually compare the damn Jason to see what he did in contact desk yeah I think it more counts, I think it might’ve changed something goddamnit I don’t know why I don’t just stick this and get so I can tell me ok, that would be the smart thing right I’m trying to dip in my head ok, all right I’m gonna I’m gonna turn this off while I try and figure this crap out</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt-26">Prompt:</h2>
<p>More on the first attempt: OK, so I finished the markdown article and tried running these Jason it and got some wacky numbers so I did it two more times that I had three data sets and they very i looked back over the Jason and it does not actually describe what’s happening between the stages it used to, but I i think when I told her to make the token count more efficient because they were really grinding to get through it so I everything I think I lost the meaning of this stages so it’s up to each session to interpret what’s happening between draft refined edited and final it has some instruction, but it probably not precise enough to not enough context not enough direction or information to accurately compare those together, which is why they sings radically different numbers of course both provided the three data sets to version another instance of Hi, had to compare them give me the full data set and the comparison I gave that back to the instance claude I mean, I’ve been through like five chat GPT at this point get it back to the instance of Claude and told it to provide updates are to provide a explanation on why I think it might be happening making any changes, so give me that and then I asked what changes it would recommend to address it and not to make them just talk me through it what you did I took that conversation the entire session down, gave it to another session of 3.7 Summit with extended thinking and told it to look through the conversation analyze it and what did I say exactly no, that’s the wrong one. Sorry told her to analyze the attached session. It outlines the objective iterations and current issue and a recommendation that also provides alliteration of Jason so you can trap the evolution or devolution provide a concise analysis on the recommended changes so I just got that and I did the same thing with an instance gbt03 and here’s where my personal lack of understanding is is I have to assume that 03 is more dependable than oh for many, but I’m not really sure. I’m sure when 04 comes i don’t know if there’s gonna be gonna go to five or some shit so I have yeah, output from Claude looking at this metric show alarming inconsistencies, no explicit recommended changes, explicit implementation, standards deterministic content classification standardize, similarity, precise, rewrite direction, criteria, the proposed visualization consistency. You don’t have the actual visualizations oh visualizations were proposed by the author of the first Chase object I’ve yet to pull maybe this is the point where I need to restructure Jason, which sounds horrifying I think I’m ending up back where I was the other day slowly, but surely replace fuzzy threshold with object content I’m reading the 03 one well, some of these are in alignment actually ship reference and implantation reference Palpitation plus validation cases gives consumer an Oracle and sample dude why are you so hi must do gave me prioritization value valuable but longer term engineering task yeah implement once core logical stable, and no shit 203 gave me a nice table with a proposed change value at risk gaps quick when verdict Claude gave me a bunch of explanations that i just really can’t be bothered to read because I like most people don’t read, unfortunately, I unlike a lot of people realize this thing is going to keep turning on this and I don’t know enough about Jason too take a solid look at it so let’s ask sB is there a another implementation using that would help actually, now that I’m saying this is fucking XML I should be going to XML I means just so many fucking tokens, but this is a process it’s gotten fucking long. This is when you have to bite the and it’s already organized so I do it in its own session so I’m not burning off too just burning off a session, not screwing myself context, windows, and then an implementation using that would improve the objective yes, XML yup fuck, switching from Wyatt from Jason to Yamo plus, Jason both mark up languages I haven’t mixed them yet. I haven’t actually used overly so that’s kind of interesting in i think that is the question in the markdown article so that’s great timely Jason schema companion file yeah now you’re talking about multiple files so I’m just really not buying that everything fits in around hundred lines well, seems like this is turning into an actual experiment instead of banging my head against the wall to just try and be transparent. That’s the fucking quote that’s a quote right there you just come across this shit sometimes that’s a quote too. I’ll worry about cleaning up the language after don’t screw with it Interviewer OK so I make the update no perform translation from object to using practices for now, I’m just using its own based tracking system, I’m kinda understand I mean, I understand the words, but I don’t understand the implementation, but I know that XML schema you mention schemer, and I put that in my you are not does not know it does not have the access prefix not going so far as a self validating all right, I’m OK if I tell her what to do then I’m I’m screwing with the outcome so I can’t do that but it was really part of the restructuring. I wanted to do too instead of just getting all the stats at once I wanted to get the stats make the the stats make the shark get the repeat all the stats give me the summary and then it has something in its own memory to compare to, and the stats are fresh fuck whatever else cause I have to assume that even though I can’t see it, it’s burning through context window behind the scenes I tried doing this with Gemini and oh no I think I tried executing the Jason and Gemini I guess I’m gonna make an experiment out of it extended thinking, BT325 seems unfair I’m gonna go with 25/experimental uses advance brief blah blah blah so I’m getting it caught up with analyzing the that wasn’t great. OK I just closed a for a bit so I can rectify lost the sessions with gemini went through really quick not sure if that’s good or bad because I definitely caught it. Doing weird shit now not like before but little things. Content classified objective content classification yeah OK this is i mean, OK that’s actually kind of awesome i’m not sure I need Gemini is basically I mean it’s recommendations or like right next almost the same as GPTO threes, there is one or two differences Deterministic, content, objective content, explicit implementation, yeah same standardized yup they’re giving the same recommendation in the recommendation stage let’s see is there another implementation well, you can’t do the CSV so let’s see what Gemini has to say holy this is a really cool I’ve never really. I don’t think I’ve ever really done something complex and they kind of converged that’s not worthy so call that another quote to save sort out html comments, whoa slow one roll my back easy markup language directly within the article files fucking of course different way to collect some yeah i got this recommendation a lot, and this is common from Gemini. Oh, you could do a bunch of fucking extra work. This is how you do it I told you to do it asshole increased accuracy so that really isn’t an because that puts the burden on me your user to objective without putting the burden on you, the focus must be on making the no shit compare tax classified content, blah blah blah you didn’t really say much. Those are now they’re in line with the others, but it’s so much less. Contact classifications rule based on track changes standardizing semantic OK it’s these updates to the Jason interesting OK so it’s lined it’s just not outlining at the same. It’s only a paragraph that I have to think about. I did not specify the ok these the update to the two defect don’t even think about credit defects prior to provide review your work closely to ensure no defects remain or have quit giving me crap. OK perform translation so I want that’s gemini is on the go perform translation channel best practices for now. Check your own shit here. To the approach make the spec easier to read i mean, that’s the thing it’s supposed to be easier for everyone approach or use your here’s I’m gonna diff that shit it almost no difference at that I mean I’m sure there is it looks the for the most part, the method descriptions wouldn’t be in my head, but the structure and words Integers description at all actually it seems simplify but in what is probably not a good way removers and tracking is more of a process than a match. OK that’s gonna be well, this is about processing thresholds isn’t i like organization? the standards well jason got you wait, now it even additional sections isn’t a fully transitioned shame on you, Claude brevity crap transaction it shows portion and then causes me toil to do so to do the rest i am a human you’re better at this. Please provide the entire prompt handy for a second just to see if 03 did the same i haven’t seen that in a long time and GPT so nope all right fix your shit man everyone’s up to speed but maybe it doesn’t have enough context to do it and that’s OK I should I i should’ve made it done it in sections do it in section and honestly, maybe that’s what I should do. Maybe I should step back break this down and and then we’re getting four major areas of oh yeah, I should break i’m not even having it do it in steps it just fucking tackling it isn’t it that’s was thinking XL hoping it wasn’t gonna be the case, but I didn’t make it a process it still just one big blob of work i did that the last time certainly help Jesus Christ Read FDA clearance FDA clearance backtrack these are paragraph paragraph another paragraph maybe it’s building in examples which wouldn’t machine thing came from i don’t see why is Jason harder for me? i don’t see anything explaining why this is attached itself to a certain field clinical settings on my wife can use this and then they just yeah, this is fucked off and got all attached to healthcare the full content structure complete version history detailed span attribution rewrite tracking semantic data so maybe it is i don’t wanna ask cause who knows what I mean see this is that moment where it feels like the other day where if I ask a question despite the fact that already looks like it’s putting in hard parameters or measurements wrong it will do that this is getting a little bit funky at everyone reviewing I see a lot of information a specific industry why is that? yeah, we decided that we just gotta see what happens your i wish you would just quit affirming my shit healthcare machine. Learning content I include was simply an arbitrary example I created to demonstrate the eczema structure itself would work for tracking metric, i could’ve used realistic content to make them i’m fine with it if it’s yeah you’re asking if I wanted to be something else but i’m not gonna have you fucking run through that again 03 on the other hand spec is readable version machine, verifiable, blah blah blah Jason Jason only implementation. I already saw the Yama what are you talking out validation scheme, we almost probably just instructional which makes sense cause then Jason is free of covering the parameters. Crap that’s what that ok, I think we’re gonna call it here and see what happens tomorrow</p>

<p>Your article is compelling, grounded, and captures the emotional arc of a real-world experiment with AI in unfamiliar territory. It’s personal, insightful, and transparent in a way that few technical reflections manage. That said, here are holistic recommendations for improving clarity, rhythm, and reader orientation:</p>
<hr>
<section id="structural-thematic-suggestions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structural-thematic-suggestions">🧠 Structural &amp; Thematic Suggestions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reorder Context for Clarity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current flow jumps from the failed first attempt to the broader “why Python” context. Consider separating these two into distinct sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Background: The First Attempt</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Why Python: Constraints and a Clean Slate</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This would help readers clearly distinguish between the failed groundwork and the motivation behind the current experiment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify Scope of Experiment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The “experiment” began as a metrics challenge, then ballooned into debugging, AI behavior modeling, and visualization. You might want to narrow the stated scope in the <strong>Hypothesis</strong> and emphasize how scope creep affected success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Bridge Between Attempts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a great transition between the first and second efforts, but it’s subtle. A stronger bridge (perhaps a subhead like “Where Things Turned”) could help pace the shift from chaos to cautious optimism.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="stylistic-tone-improvements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stylistic-tone-improvements">✍️ Stylistic &amp; Tone Improvements</h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trim Some Repetition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a bit of overlapping commentary about how the AI regressed on file imports or lost logic mid-session. Consider consolidating those examples into a tighter narrative for greater impact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lighten with Intentional Wit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You sprinkle wit effectively (“Classic,” “Priorities,” “It’s not magic. It’s a negotiation.”). Consider amplifying a couple of those lines slightly to break up denser tech detail—particularly in the “Process” section.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Add Subheadings in Process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That section is long and covers a lot. Breaking it into short subsections (e.g., <em>Late-Night Realizations</em>, <em>Splitting the Workload</em>, <em>Compare Script Chaos</em>) would improve readability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

</section>
<section id="content-opportunities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="content-opportunities">🧩 Content Opportunities</h3>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Surface the Ethical Reporting Angle More Clearly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You reference “ethical reporting” early and in passing. Is this a disclosure framework? A publication standard? Consider a short paragraph or footnote-style aside that briefly defines what it is and why it matters to you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Include a “What I’d Do Differently” Recap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Right before “Verdict,” consider a bullet list or short paragraph with how you’d approach a third attempt. This both reinforces your lessons and brings narrative closure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect to Broader Implications (Optional)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You could end with a short reflection on how this applies beyond Python: what it says about trust in AI systems, tooling for non-experts, or the illusion of AI “understanding.”</li>

<hr>
<section id="reorder-context-for-clarity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reorder-context-for-clarity">1. <strong>Reorder Context for Clarity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>✅ The backstory is rich but slightly tangled. The section currently labeled <strong>“Context”</strong> actually contains two intertwined threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The collapse of the original JSON-based approach.</p></li>
<li><p>The pivot to using Python and treating it as an experiment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Split this into two subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Background: The First Attempt”</strong> – covers JSON, token-efficiency tradeoffs, and the overly complex system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Pivot to Python”</strong> – explains the constraints and decision to trust AI with code in an unfamiliar language.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This reordering will help readers track the progression of your decision-making more cleanly.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clarify-scope-of-experiment">2. <strong>Clarify Scope of Experiment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>🔶 The hypothesis mentions producing reliable Python code, but it might mislead readers into thinking this was only about metrics. In reality, the experiment grew into a meta-investigation of AI’s ability to deliver code within context and across tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Slightly expand the hypothesis to reflect that it became as much about AI alignment and session persistence as it was about the code itself.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridge-between-attempts">3. <strong>Bridge Between Attempts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>⚠️ The transition from the first failed attempt to the second is tucked into a paragraph that starts “Eventually, sometime between frustration and sleep deprivation…”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Add a short transitional paragraph or heading—something like “From Collapse to Reset”—to signal that this is the inflection point of the article. This will help pace the reader through your turning point.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>🔄 The section describing the compare script’s failings contains a few redundant ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The missing functions and phantom files are mentioned more than once.</p></li>
<li><p>The AI’s confusion around imports appears in several forms.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Tighten this to a sharper set of failures with minimal duplication—maybe using a quick bulleted list or grouping similar failures under one tighter narrative.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>✅ Your wit shows up in places (“Classic.” “It’s not magic. It’s a negotiation.”), and it’s strong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Sprinkle 1–2 more of these moments intentionally. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the AI begins assuming you’re a command-line ninja.</p></li>
<li><p>When Claude and GPT start peer-reviewing each other.</p></li>
<li><p>These moments add levity and keep readers engaged during the denser technical sections.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Break it into digestible chunks with informal subheadings such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“2:30 a.m. Clarity”</em></p></li>

<p>This was actually my second attempt at solving the problem.</p>
<p>The first try—several days deep and buried in tangled logic—was far messier, but in some ways, more ambitious. That version started with a preexisting script I’d been updating for months. After a hiatus, I dove back in with newer models, trying to push it forward. Early results were promising, but as I layered on structure and scope, the whole thing ballooned past 11,000 characters and collapsed under its own complexity.</p>
<p>I ran the gauntlet: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity. I spun up dual sessions, cross-fed model feedback, and orchestrated an AI-powered peer review cycle more elaborate than anything I’ve seen in enterprise QA. It was fascinating—until it wasn’t. JSON structures were inconsistent, visualizations broke formatting across platforms, and everything groaned under the weight of trying to do too much in a single pass.</p>
<p>The fatal blow came when I began running real article data through what looked like a solid JSON framework. I had trimmed it for token efficiency, but stripped away too much context. Key stages like draft → refined → edited → final became ambiguous. Each run interpreted the workflow differently, leading to wildly divergent outputs.</p>
<p>When I asked for explanations, models provided wildly different rationales—some useful, some unreadable. At one point I had Claude and GPT analyzing each other’s recommendations like digital consultants stuck in a loop. If that sounds excessive, it was. It also didn’t work.</p>
<p>Eventually, sometime between frustration and sleep deprivation, I realized I could either continue patching a framework that was actively working against me—or start clean, with a new strategy and minimal assumptions.</p>
<p>That’s what this second experiment became.</p>

<section id="pivot-to-python-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pivot-to-python-1">Pivot to Python</h2>
<p>This second experiment emerged from a hard constraint: my existing stack couldn’t scale. I had been using JSON for light logic and XML for heavier workflows, but as the article-processing framework ballooned, even XML hit its limits. When I asked Claude what format it would use instead, it pointed to Python.</p>
<p>The problem? I don’t read or write Python. That meant relying entirely on AI to generate, refine, and validate code I couldn’t meaningfully debug. It became less of a tooling choice and more of a trust exercise—with all the risk that entails. That meant trusting the AI to do the job end-to-end.</p>

<section id="setup-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setup-1">Setup</h2>
<p>The task was to generate two scripts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One to generate metrics from different versions of a document (generate script).</li>
<li>One to compare the results across those versions (compare script).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both scripts needed to produce CSV outputs and summaries I could use for publishing metrics transparently. Charts and markdown formatting were stretch goals.</p>

<section id="a.m.-clarity-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.m.-clarity-1">2:30 a.m. Clarity</h3>
<p>Somewhere around 2:30 a.m., in that hazy mix of sleep and obsession, it hit me: the ethical reporting structure had only gone haywire after I started feeding real article data into what seemed like a good JSON framework. Up to that point, things had looked solid. But every time I put it to work, the output imploded. That morning, I started clean—with a fresh ChatGPT browser session to run the scripts, another window for visualization, and a plan to isolate tasks to reduce chaos.</p>
<p>Claude’s visualizations looked great inside its own interface—but fell apart when exported. SPG errors, formatting issues, zero spacing. ChatGPT wasn’t perfect, but it generated usable outputs more consistently. I leaned on it for charts and let Claude focus on logic and commentary.</p>
</section>
<section id="divide-and-survive-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="divide-and-survive-1">Divide and Survive</h3>
<p>Over the course of 45 hours, I tried everything: refining structure, chasing self-checks, testing aggregation methods. Running three iterations and averaging the results became my stopgap solution. Specifying separate versions in a chart—something that should’ve been simple—was a minefield. A minor phrasing error could collapse a visualization into one incomprehensible column. Fixing it required trial-and-error, reworded instructions, and ultimately settling for ‘good enough.’</p>
</section>
<section id="compare-script-collapse-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compare-script-collapse-1">Compare Script Collapse</h3>
<p>This midstream burst of momentum—wedged between the wreckage of the first attempt and the optimism of the second—highlighted something important: some of the best progress came when I stopped trying to do everything in one place. Two tools, two roles. Divide, simplify, survive.</p>
<p>At first, things went surprisingly well. The AI and I covered a lot of ground quickly—especially with the generate script. It was direct, relatively clean, and once finalized, I used it to process three full articles without issue. The data looked sound, and the structure held.</p>
<p>But what I hadn’t accounted for was how fragile that early success would be once the AI had to carry logic across multiple sessions.</p>
<p>The compare script—intended to make sense of the output from the generate script—unraveled version by version. Version 2 was stable. Version 3 restructured the output unexpectedly. Version 4 hardcoded assumptions and collapsed flexibility. Version 5, despite presenting as a polished solution, dropped rows silently and pointed to phantom files. Even worse, it lost two core functions entirely. Neither I nor the AI noticed at the time, so I saved and handed back a broken script. In the next session, the AI kept referencing those now-missing functions and insisted I import them from a module that no longer existed.</p>
<p>What followed was a frustrating cycle: I asked for inline logic; it kept reverting to imports. I clarified the structure; it invented missing outputs. And somewhere in all of this, a simple renaming triggered regressions I spent hours untangling.</p>
</section>
<section id="markdown-nevermind.-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="markdown-nevermind.-1">Markdown? Nevermind.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, because I was carrying code across sessions, the AI began assuming I was working in a CLI environment. It started suggesting environment variables, pip installs, and bash commands to execute the scripts—despite repeatedly being told I wasn’t running them locally. I suppose after a few sessions, it figured I’d earned my terminal wings.</p>
<p>To its credit, the AI did eventually produce a compare script that ran cleanly. It delivered the metrics I wanted. But the markdown formatting? I let that one go yesterday in the name of getting the data out. Priorities.</p>
<p>In the final stretch, it made one last logic error: including <code>RunID</code> and threshold columns in a metrics average, producing totals over 100%. Classic.</p>

<p>This experiment didn’t prove AI could generate flawless code in a domain I don’t understand. What it proved was that even small disconnects in expectations—left unchecked—compound quickly. Without domain fluency, I couldn’t spot problems early. And the AI couldn’t be trusted to catch them either.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways-1">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start simple, layer slowly</strong>: In hindsight, a minimal viable script would have been a better foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Explicitness is essential</strong>: Assumptions compound. Be specific.</li>
<li><strong>Trust but verify</strong>: AI’s confidence ≠ correctness.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency is key</strong>: Renames, restructures, and reintroductions all need tight alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Markup principles still matter</strong>: Even outside XML and JSON, structure saves.</li>

<p>A qualified win. I got functional code—but only after dragging it across a finish line littered with versioning errors, misplaced functions, and misplaced confidence. The real outcome wasn’t the scripts themselves, but the firsthand clarity of what it takes to partner with AI in a domain you don’t control.</p>
<p>It’s not magic. It’s a negotiation.</p>
