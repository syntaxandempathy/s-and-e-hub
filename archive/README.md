# AI Content Generation Trials: 2024 Archive

_This directory contains a year's worth of experiment logs detailing the use of AI in content creation._

**Overview**

This archive stores Markdown files documenting a year-long project (2024) that explored the capabilities of several AI models (Bard, Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT-4, and LLaMA) in generating content about global holiday traditions.  Each file represents a set of experiments conducted in a specific month, detailing prompts, AI responses, and analysis of results. The experiments focused on refining prompts, leveraging AI roles, and evaluating output quality. This archive serves as a comprehensive record of the project's progress and findings.  The files are organized chronologically by month and then by part number within each month.

**Structure**

Each monthly log is divided into numbered parts (`pt-1`, `pt-2`, etc.).  Each part typically focuses on a specific aspect of the AI experimentation within that month.  All files follow a consistent structure, beginning with a preface describing the month's goals and including a TL;DR summary at the beginning.

**Conventions**

Markdown files use consistent formatting and headings.  File names follow a consistent pattern (`ai-trials-month-pt-number.md`).
